Aston Villa Football Club are a professional football club based in Aston, Birmingham, England. They were founded in 1874 and compete in the Premier League, the top division of English football. The club has won the FA Cup seven times and the Football League Cup five times. They reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 1982, but lost 3–1 to Spanish side Barcelona. As of the end of the 2014–15 season, Aston Villa have spent 66 seasons in the top-flight of English football, most recently being relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2014–15 season after 26 years.

#  Which striker scored the most goals for Aston Villa FC in a season? 

Aston Villa have had some top strikers in their history, with many scoring goals on a regular basis. But which one scored the most in a season?

Gabriel Agbonlahor is the club’s all-time record goal scorer, and he netted 26 goals during the 2009-10 season. This was a huge achievement, as it helped Villa to secure Premier League safety and also reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup.

Interestingly, Agbonlahor’s record was matched by Christian Benteke during the 2014-15 season. The Belgian striker was signed from Genk in 2012, and has since been one of Villa’s most important players. He was pivotal in their run to the FA Cup final that year, scoring 19 goals in all competitions.

Benteke eventually left Villa for Liverpool in 2015, but his legacy still remains. Agbonlahor may have set the record initially, but Benteke arguably surpassed it in terms of quality and importance to the team.

#  Who is the current manager of Aston Villa FC?
