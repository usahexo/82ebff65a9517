#  How to Win at Blackjack in Bhutan - The Ultimate Guide 

In a country as isolated as Bhutan, it's no wonder that the traditional card game of blackjack has taken on such importance. Known locally as "21", blackjack is a game that can be traced back to 17th century France, and it has been enjoyed by people all over the world ever since. 

Like any other game, there are strategies that can help you win at blackjack in Bhutan. But before we get into those, let's take a look at the basics of the game. 

The aim of blackjack is to accumulate as many points as possible, without going over 21. Points are scored by counting the value of the cards: an Ace counts as 1 point, 2s to 10s count as their face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (known as a "court card") count as 10 points. An Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 points, whichever works best for you. 

The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins - unless they go over 21, in which case they lose automatically. 

Now that you know how to play blackjack in Bhutan, let's take a look at some strategy tips. 

1) Don't go over 21! This may seem like an obvious one, but it's worth remembering nonetheless. If your total score goes over 21, you automatically lose the game. 

2) always stand when your total score is 17 or more. This increases your chances of winning by preventing you from going bust (scoring over 21). 

3) Split pairs of 8s or Aces. This gives you two chances to score points instead of just one. 

4) Double down when your total score is 9 or 11. This means doubling your bet and then getting one more card from the dealer. It's a risky move but it can pay off if you're lucky. 

5) Use basic strategy charts to help make decisions during the game. These charts are available online or in books dedicated to blackjack strategy. They will tell you what moves to make depending on the cards you are dealt.
