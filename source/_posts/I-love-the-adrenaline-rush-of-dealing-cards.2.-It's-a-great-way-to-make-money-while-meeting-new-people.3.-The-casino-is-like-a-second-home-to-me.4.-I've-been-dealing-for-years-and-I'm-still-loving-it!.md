When I was younger, I loved to go to the casino and play the slots. But as I got older, I realized that I could make money by dealing cards. And so began my career in gaming.

# 5. No day is ever the same when you're a dealer at a casino.

I've never had a job where no day is ever the same, until I started dealers school and became a casino dealer.  Dealers are the backbone of any casino - we make sure that players are able to enjoy their time at the casino by dealing them cards and managing games. It's a job that can be both exhilarating and stressful, depending on the day. 

Some days, I'm dealing blackjack all day long and I might get a break for a little while to eat lunch. Other days, I could be playing multiple games simultaneously - it really all depends on the needs of the casino. You never really know what to expect when you walk into work each morning, but that's one of the things that I love about my job. 

Another thing I love about being a dealer is the people I work with. We have a great group of dealers at our casino and we all help each other out when things get busy. It's like one big happy family - we all look out for each other and we have a lot of fun together too. 

Of course, there are also downsides to being a dealer. There can be some long hours during busy times and you definitely need to be able to handle stress well. But overall, I think it's an excellent job and I'm grateful that I've been given the opportunity to do it.
