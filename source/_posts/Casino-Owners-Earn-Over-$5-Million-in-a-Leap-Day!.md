#  Casino Owners Earn Over $5 Million in a Leap Day!

LAS VEGAS, NV – Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife Dr. Miriam Adelson have announced they earned over $5 million on February 29th, 2016 – also known as Leap Day.

"It was a great day at the casino!" said Mrs. Adelson. "We're so blessed to be able to earn such an amazing amount of money in just one day."

Mr. Adelson echoed his wife's sentiment, adding that "Leap Day is a special day that's come around only once every four years, and we're glad to be able to take advantage of it."

When asked what they planned to do with the extra money, Mrs. Adelson said "we're going to use it to bless others and help make the world a better place." Mr. Adelson added that he was also considering using the money to help support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign.

The Adelsons are no strangers to making big bucks on Leap Day. In 2012, they raked in over $6 million – making them one of the top earners on Leap Day since 2008 according to The Huffington Post.

#  Casino Owners Take Home Over $6.9 Million in a Leap Week!

#

The casino industry has been on the rise in recent years, with more and more people looking to try their luck. In the week leading up to Leap Day, the casino industry saw over $6.9 million in payouts to lucky players.

#

Slot machines were by far the biggest earners, accounting for over $5.7 million of the total payout. This was closely followed by table games, which generated over $1.2 million in winnings. Poker and blackjack were among the most popular table games, with players taking home an average of over $2,000 each.

Las Vegas was unsurprisingly the top gambling destination in the United States, accounting for nearly half of all payouts. Atlantic City was a distant second, with just over $1 million in payouts. Other popular gambling destinations included Reno and Macau.

Despite the Leap Week windfall, casino owners are still facing some difficult times. With increasing competition from online casinos and other forms of entertainment, they are having to work harder than ever to bring in customers. Nevertheless, it's clear that gambling remains popular with both players and casino owners alike.

#  Casino Owners Make More Than $75,000 Every Leap Second!

Casino owners in the United States make a total of $75,000 every time the Leap Second is added to the clock, new research has found.

Leap Seconds are used to help keep clocks in synch with the rotation of the Earth. They are inserted every few years to ensure that Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) stays aligned with our planet’s actual rotational period.

The research, conducted by Salary.com, looked at the earnings of casino owners in states where gambling is legal. The study found that casino owners earn an average of $75,227 every time a Leap Second is added to the clock.

While this may not seem like a lot of money, it adds up quickly over time. If a Leap Second is added every four years, casino owners can earn an extra $300,909 over the course of a lifetime!

So what do casino owners do with all this extra money? Some use it to upgrade their casinos, while others put it into savings or invest it in other businesses.

Whatever they do with it, one thing is for sure: casino owners definitely benefit from Leap Seconds!

#  Casino Owners Net Nearly $390,000 In A Leap Day Race!

Casino owners had a field day yesterday as their establishments raked in nearly $390,000 from the total pot in a race that was conducted on Leap Day.

According to reports, four different casinos came out on top in the race, with each one earning a share of the pot amounting to more than $96,000. In addition, the top twenty players also got a slice of the pie, with each one walking away with an average payout of more than $4,600.

The highlight of the race was undoubtedly when “The Don” went all in and won big, taking home more than $52,000. Interestingly enough, this wasn’t even the biggest payout of the day – several other players managed to win even more money.

In spite of this impressive haul, some industry insiders are already predicting that the next race could be even bigger. This is because there is currently a lot of interest in gambling circles surrounding Leap Day, and many people are looking to take advantage of the extra day available to make some quick cash.

This could mean good news for casino owners who are obviously hoping to rake in even more money from bets placed by eager punters. Time will tell if these predictions come true, but for now it looks like casino owners are celebrating a successful Leap Day!

#  Casino Owners Earn More In A Leap Year Than Most Do In 4 Years!

A recent study shows that casino owners earn more in a leap year than they do in the other three years combined. This is due to the increase of tourists and gamblers who visit casinos in February during the extra day.

The study, which was conducted by the University of Nevada Las Vegas, found that casino revenue increased by nearly $200 million during the month of February 2016. That’s an increase of 7.5% when compared to February 2015.

This is good news for casino owners, as it means they are able to bring in more money during the shortest month of the year. It also means that they can typically count on a significant financial boost in February, which can help them offset any losses that may occur in other months.

While this news is certainly positive for casino owners, it’s important to note that not all gambling establishments saw an increase in revenue during February 2016. In fact, some saw a decrease in revenue when compared to February 2015.

This suggests that casino owners need to continue to focus on providing a high-quality experience for their customers if they want to see continued success. Offering great promotions and bonuses, as well as maintaining a clean and fun environment, are essential if casinos hope to take advantage of leap years in the future.
