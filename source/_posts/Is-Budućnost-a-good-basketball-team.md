#  Is Budućnost a good basketball team?

It is hard to judge how good Budućnost really is, as they have not played any official games yet. However, their preseason results look promising and they are definitely one of the favourites to win the championship this season. Some players to watch out for include Bojan Dubljević, Jusuf Nurkić and Nikola Vujčić. Budućnost will be looking to improve on their third-place finish from last year.

#  NBA betting tips: How to make money on Budućnost

The Budućnost basketball club has always been one of the most popular teams in Montenegro. But with their recent success in the EuroLeague, they have also become a hot commodity for NBA betting fans. So how can you make money on this team?

One approach is to look at spreads and totals. For example, the Budućnost vs Olympiacos game on December 12th had a spread of -7.5 for Olympiacos and a total of 161 points. If you bet on Olympiacos to cover the spread, they would need to win by at least 7 points. If you bet on the over, then you would need at least 172 points to be scored in the game.

Another approach is to look at head-to-head matchups between two teams. In the matchup between Budućnost and Olympiacos, Olympiacos was a big favorite. However, when you look at matchups between other teams in the EuroLeague, it can be more difficult to find clear favorites. This makes it possible to find good value bets by comparing odds from different bookmakers.

Finally, it’s important to stay up-to-date on news and injuries affecting European basketball teams. For example, if Nikola Vucevic of Orlando Magic is set to play for Budućnost in an upcoming game, that information can impact the betting odds significantly. By following news items like this, you can get an edge on the competition and make more informed bets.

#  Budućnost wins big against Igokea

The Budućnost Voli basketball team won convincingly against Igokea in the Aleksandar Nikolić Hall on Sunday evening, 93-73.

The home side had complete control of the game right from the start and led by as many as 26 points in the third quarter. Igokea never looked like mounting a serious challenge and were booed off the court by their own fans at the final whistle.

It was a good team performance from Budućnost, with five players scoring in double figures. Bojan Bogdanović led the way with 23 points, while Aaron Craft added 18 points, six assists and five rebounds.

The result means that Budućnost are now second in Group A, just a point behind leaders Partizan Belgrade. They will be looking to secure their place in the next round when they travel to Ljubljana to face Olimpija Ljubljana on Wednesday.

#  Sports betting: What do -2.5 and +2.5 mean?

When you see a point spread in sports betting, it will look something like this: New York Jets -2.5. This means that the Jets are the favorites and they are giving up 2.5 points to the opponent. So, if you want to bet on the Jets, you must give up 2.5 points in order to win $100. Conversely, if you want to bet on the opponent, they must win by more than 2.5 points for you to collect your winnings.

On the other hand, a point spread of +2.5 means that the underdog is given 2.5 points head start. So, if you wager on them, they can lose by up to 2 points and you would still win your bet. Likewise, a bet on the favorite would have to win by more than 2 points in order to cover the point spread.

#  Why did Budućnost lose by 2.5 points?

A close game in Podgorica saw Budućnost lose to KK Cibona by 2.5 points. While fans of the home team might be scratching their heads as to how they lost, a closer examination of the stats offers some clues.

Budućnost shot very poorly from beyond the arc, making only six of their 26 three-point attempts (23%). In contrast, Cibona shot an impressive 50% from downtown. This discrepancy was decisive in the final result.

In addition, Budućnost turnovers proved costly. They averaged 15 turnovers per game this season, while Cibona averaged only 11.7 turnovers per game. Giving the ball away more often resulted in more opportunities for the visitors to score easy points.

Finally, Budućnost was outrebounded by Cibona 46-40. This was also a key factor in the final outcome, as it translated into more second-chance points for the Croatian side.

Altogether, these factors explain why Budućnost lost by a relatively narrow margin despite playing poorly from three-point range and turning the ball over frequently.
