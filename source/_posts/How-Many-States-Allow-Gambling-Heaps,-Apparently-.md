#  How Many States Allow Gambling? Heaps, Apparently 

If you’re looking to gamble and aren’t sure about where to go, don’t worry – you have plenty of options. Depending on your definition of gambling, up to 47 states allow some form of it, with only Utah, Hawaii, and Nevada completely banning nearly all forms.

Gambling can encompass a wide range of activities, from playing the lottery to betting on sports to playing in a casino. So which states allow what?

Lottery: All but four states (Alabama, Alaska, Mississippi, and South Carolina) have some form of state-run lottery.

Casinos: There are no federal regulations prohibiting casinos, so they’re allowed in pretty much every state. You can find them in 40 states plus Washington D.C.

Sports betting: This is a bit more contentious, as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) made sports betting illegal outside of Nevada. However, PASPA was recently ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court, opening the door for other states to start up their own sports betting industries. As of now, only New Jersey has moved forward with plans for sports betting, but other states are likely to follow soon.

Poker: Poker is allowed in 29 states (plus D.C.). The specific laws around poker vary from state to state, but in general it’s seen as a game of skill rather than chance and is thus allowed.

So there you have it – if you want to gamble and you’re not limited by location, there’s probably a way to do it somewhere in the US. Just be sure to brush up on your local laws before you start placing any bets!

#  Gambling Appears to be Legal in Most US States 

A recent study by Adam L. Pregill of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas has found that gambling is legal in most US states. The study, which was published in the journal Judicature, surveyed the gambling laws of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Pregill found that only six states have a complete ban on gambling: Hawaii, Utah, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Iowa. In most other states, gambling is either expressly allowed or not specifically prohibited.

This appears to be good news for casinos and other gambling operators. Casino companies such as MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd have recently been expanding their operations into new states such as Massachusetts and Mississippi.

However, there are still some restrictions on gambling. For example, many states prohibit people from casino gambling if they are under the age of 21 or if they are on parole or probation. Additionally, some states prohibit certain types of gambling (such as online betting) while others have Slot Machine Parity Laws which require casinos to offer the same percentage return on slot machines games.

The study also found that state lottery revenues continue to grow each year. In 2017, state lotteries generated over $78 billion in revenue- a record high. This is due in part to the increasing popularity of scratch-off tickets and Powerball jackpots.

#  States Allowing Gambling Continues to Grow 

States legislatures and voters are continuing to expand legalized gambling, with new casinos, lotteries, and other gaming operations cropping up every day. The trend shows few signs of slowing down, as states see the potential revenue growth and job creation from gambling as too great to ignore.

Supporters of gambling argue that it is a form of entertainment that can be enjoyed responsibly and that it brings much-needed revenue to state governments. Detractors claim that gambling addiction ruins lives and causes financial ruin for many people.

The debate about the pros and cons of gambling is sure to continue, but one thing is for sure – the legalization of gambling is continuing to spread across the United States.
