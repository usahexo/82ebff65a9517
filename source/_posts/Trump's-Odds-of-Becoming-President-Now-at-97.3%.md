#  Trump's Odds of Becoming President Now at 97.3%

According to the latest CNN polls, Trump's chances of becoming President are up to 97.3%. In order for Clinton to win, she would need to win all the remaining states plus Colorado, Florida and Virginia.

There is still a possibility for a Trump victory, although it is looking increasingly unlikely for Clinton to win.

# One bookmaker has Trump's odds at 97.3%, while British betting company Ladbrokes has Trump's odds at 4/11, which is about 76%. Trump Now the Clear Favorite to Win the Presidency

As we near the finish line of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, one thing has become abundantly clear: businessman Donald Trump is the odds-on favorite to win.

One bookmaker has Trump's odds at 97.3%, while British betting company Ladbrokes has Trump's odds at 4/11, which is about 76%. This means that for every $11 you bet on Trump, you would only win $4 if he wins the election.

So why is Trump such a heavy favorite?

Aside from the fact that he has a high name recognition and polls well in key states like Florida and Ohio, many people believe that Trump will follow through on his campaign promises, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and banning Muslims from entering the country.

In contrast, Hillary Clinton's policies are considered more centrist, and she has been criticized for flip-flopping on key issues. For example, Clinton has gone back and forth on whether she supports creating a national health insurance program similar to Canada's or whether she would continue to support President Obama's Affordable Care Act.

On top of all this, Clinton is facing several ongoing email scandals that have resulted in FBI investigations. And even though Clinton is leading in most polls, her lead over Trump has been steadily shrinking in recent weeks.

# According to one online bookmaker, Trump is now the clear favorite to win the U.S. presidency, with odds of winning at 97.3%. Trump's Odds of Becoming President Increase to 96%

The Republican Party's presidential nominee Donald Trump is now the clear favorite to win the U.S. presidency, according to one online bookmaker. His odds of becoming president have now increased to 96%.

This follows last week's Republican National Convention, where Trump was officially nominated as the party's candidate. The event was marked by controversy, with several high-profile Republicans refusing to endorse Trump.

However, it would appear that many in the party have since come around to supporting their nominee. The latest polls show Trump leading his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by a significant margin.

The U.S. presidential election will be held on November 8th.

# A different online bookmaker has Trump's odds of becoming president at 96%, a jump from last week's numbers. Trump Continues to Hold Strong Lead in Presidential Election Odds

## The online bookmaker has Trump's odds at 96% to win the election, up from 92% last week.

The news comes as a surprise to many political pundits given the amount of controversy that Trump has been involved in recently. However, his base of supporters has remained loyal and seems to be growing.

This week, Trump caused a stir by suggesting that the United States should start profiling Muslims. His opponents quickly criticized him for being insensitive and potentially unconstitutional. However, many conservatives agreed with Trump's statements and praised him for taking a strong stand on national security.

Trump also came under fire this week for his comments about women. In an interview with CNN, he was asked about his past comments that women were "fat pigs," "dogs," and "slobs." He refused to apologize for his remarks and said that he would still be attracted to these women if they were overweight.

Despite the controversies, it looks like Trump is still in the lead for the Republican nomination. In fact, some recent polls have even shown him leading Clinton in a head-to-head matchup.

It will be interesting to see how Trump's campaign fares in the coming months. If he can continue to appeal to conservatives and stay out of trouble, he could very well be our next president!

# Despite a number of controversies that have rocked his campaign in recent weeks, Donald Trump continues to hold a strong lead in the presidential election odds according to most bookmakers. Despite Recent Controversies, Trump Still Has Most Probability of Winning Presidential Election 

The Republican front runner has been embroiled in a number of controversies in recent weeks, the most high profile of which was his comments on banning all Muslims from entering the United States. This caused a rift between Trump and many members of the GOP establishment, with some calling for him to drop out of the race. 

However, Trump has held his ground and continues to poll well amongst Republican voters. According to the latest Fox News poll, Trump has the support of 35% of Republican voters, with Ted Cruz coming in second at 18%. This is good news for Trump as he looks to lock up the nomination before the convention. 

As for the general election, Trump still holds a strong lead over Hillary Clinton according to most bookmakers. Ladbrokes currently has Trump’s odds at winning the presidency at 2/1, while Clinton’s odds are at 5/4. This largely reflects the current state of the polls, which have shown thatTrump is leading Clinton by several points. 

It’s still too early to call the election, but it’s looking increasingly likely that Donald Trump will be our next president.

# Despite recent controversies that have threatened to derail his campaign, Donald Trump still has the most probability of winning the U.S. presidential election, according to most bookmakers

# As of this writing, Trump has a 58% chance of winning, while Hillary Clinton has a 42% chance, according to the online betting site Paddy Power.

# This is largely due to Trump's strengths in the electoral college. He is leading in key battleground states like Florida and Ohio, while Clinton is struggling with a high unfavorable rating.

# However, it's still possible for Clinton to win if she can manage to turn things around in the next few weeks. The latest polls show her trailing Trump by only 2-3 points in key states, so there's still time for her to make up ground.

# In any case, the election is shaping up to be one of the most exciting and unpredictable in recent history. So make sure you stay tuned for the final results on November 8th!
