#  typically the how leave their mark on poker Eintracht Frankfurt and prove they are the best!

This season in the Bundesliga, there is one team that is flying high above all the rest. Eintracht Frankfurt have been a revelation and are currently top of the table, with a goal difference of +22! They have beaten some of the biggest teams in Germany, including Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig. So how have they managed to achieve this incredible feat?

Some would say that it is down to their manager Niko Kovac. Kovac has been in charge at Frankfurt since 2016, and has turned them from relegation strugglers into title challengers. He has a very attacking style of football, which has led to some thrilling performances from his team.

However, it is not just Kovac that has led Frankfurt to success this season. The players themselves have also played a huge role. One player who has particularly impressed is Sebastien Haller. The French striker joined Frankfurt from Dutch side Utrecht in the summer and has already scored 14 goals in 21 appearances. He is proving to be a real threat to opposition defences and looks set to score many more goals for Eintracht Frankfurt this season.

 Another player who has been key for Frankfurt this season is Luka Jovic. The young Serbian striker joined the club from Benfica in the summer and has quickly established himself as one of the most dangerous players in the Bundesliga. He has scored 11 goals in 17 appearances so far this season, and looks poised to become one of Europe’s top strikers in the future.

Together, Haller and Jovic have formed a deadly strike partnership which has been instrumental in Frankfurt’s success this season. They are both extremely talented players who are capable of scoring goals against any team in the world. If they continue playing at this level, there is no doubt that Eintracht Frankfurt will be crowned Bundesliga champions at the end of the season.
