<h1 id="Make-a-Killing-Betting-on-Soccer-Games-SSC-Napoli"><a href="#Make-a-Killing-Betting-on-Soccer-Games-SSC-Napoli" class="headerlink" title="Make a Killing Betting on Soccer Games: SSC Napoli"></a>Make a Killing Betting on Soccer Games: SSC Napoli</h1><p>SSC Napoli had an eventful 2016-17 season. The Neapolitan club achieved a record 91 points in Serie A and finished runners-up, two points behind Juventus. They also reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, losing to eventual winners Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Since their runner-up finish in 2017, SSC Napoli has been one of the most successful clubs in Europe. They reached the Champions League group stage for the second consecutive year and are currently first in their group with six points from two games.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore three reasons why now might be a good time to bet on SSC Napoli.</p>
<ol>
<li>Strong Squad Depth</li>
</ol>
<p>One reason to back SSC Napoli is their strong squad depth. The likes of José Callejón, Lorenzo Insigne and Dries Mertens can all change a game on their own, while new signings Fabián Ruiz and Simone Verdi have also impressed so far this season.</p>
<p>Manager Carlo Ancelotti has also shown he is not afraid to use young players, such as 19-year-old defender Kalidou Koulibaly. This gives SSC Napoli plenty of options when it comes to selecting a starting XI, which could give them an edge over their opponents.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Excellent Managerial pedigree</li>
</ol>
<p>Another reason to back SSC Napoli is their excellent managerial pedigree. Manager Carlo Ancelotti has won trophies at some of Europe’s biggest clubs, including Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. He is known for his tactical nous and ability to get the best out of his players – something that could be crucial in Europe’s elite club competition.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Strong Home Record</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, one reason to back SSC Napoli is their strong home record. The Neapolitans have only lost eight times at home in Serie A since 2016-17 – an impressive record that could lead to profits for those who bet on them winning their matches at the San Paolo Stadium.</p>
<h1 id="SSC-Napoli-—-The-Best-Way-to-Profit-from-Soccer-Mad-Fans"><a href="#SSC-Napoli-—-The-Best-Way-to-Profit-from-Soccer-Mad-Fans" class="headerlink" title="SSC Napoli — The Best Way to Profit from Soccer Mad Fans!"></a>SSC Napoli — The Best Way to Profit from Soccer Mad Fans!</h1><p>Since the early 1900s, Napoli has been one of the most passionate and supported football clubs in Italy. The fans are often called “ultras” and are known for their sing-chanting, flares, and undying devotion to their team.</p>
<p>This fandom can be a great opportunity to make some money. Here’s how you can profit from football mad fans of SSC Napoli:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy shares in the club.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is probably the safest option if you want to make a long-term investment in SSC Napoli. The club is currently owned by Aurelio De Laurentiis, who took over in 2004. He has been a successful owner, transforming the team into a Serie A powerhouse. As of July 2019, the club is valued at €300 million.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bet on matches.</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoli is a very strong side and usually performs well in Serie A. This means that they are often favourites to win matches. However, as with any sport, there is always risk involved when betting on matches. Make sure you do your research before placing any bets!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Sell merchandise.</li>
</ol>
<p>Napoli has a huge fanbase all over the world. This presents an opportunity to sell merchandise to these supporters. You can set up an online store or sell items at local fan meetings and events.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Create a fan website or blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many websites and blogs out there that cover SSC Napoli news and matches. Why not start your own? This can be a great way to attract traffic and make some money from advertising revenue or affiliate commissions.</p>
<h1 id="Building-a-Sports-Betting-Empire-SSC-Napoli-Style"><a href="#Building-a-Sports-Betting-Empire-SSC-Napoli-Style" class="headerlink" title="Building a Sports Betting Empire: SSC Napoli Style!"></a>Building a Sports Betting Empire: SSC Napoli Style!</h1><p>SSC Napoli have been one of the surprise packages of the Serie A this season.</p>
<p>With new manager, Maurizio Sarri, at the helm, they have turned themselves into a formidable force and sit in second place in the table, only four points behind leaders Juventus.</p>
<p>But can they maintain their challenge for the title and go all the way? Or will they eventually falter?</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a closer look at SSC Napoli, their squad and their chances of winning the Serie A this season. We will also examine how you can use their current form to make money from betting on them.</p>
<p>Formation and Squad</p>
<p>Sarri has favoured a 4-3-3 formation since taking over as manager last summer. This has suited the players at his disposal down to the ground and has seen some excellent results. The likes of Marek Hamsik, Jose Callejon and Lorenzo Insigne have been given plenty of freedom to roam and cause havoc amongst opposition defences.</p>
<p>Goalkeepers: Pepe Reina (Spain), Rafael (Brazil), Luigi Sepe (Italy)<br>D defenders: Ivan Strinic (Croatia), Kalidou Koulibaly (Senegal), Raul Albiol (Spain), Faouzi Ghoulam (Algeria), Elseid Hysaj (Albania) M defenders: Allan (Brazil), Jorginho (Italy), Zielinski (Poland) AMR: Callejon (Spain), Mertens (Belgium), Insigne (Italy) AMC: Hamsik (Slovakia), Rog (Croatia) F strikers: Duvan Zapata (Colombia), Milik (Poland) </p>
<p>Their average age is 26 years old which gives them plenty of scope for improvement in the years to come. Sarri has also been able to call upon some impressive back-up players when needed such as Duvan Zapata and Arkadiusz Milik. Both strikers have scored crucial goals this season when called upon. This makes Napoli a very dangerous team to face off against should one of their main stars be unavailable for any reason.<br>What’s more, with the likes of Kalidou Koulibaly, Faouzi Ghoulam and Elseid Hysaj in defence, Napoli have one of the strongest defences in Europe. They have only conceded 14 goals in 18 games so far this season – a record that is bettered by only five other teams in Europe’s top five leagues! This solidity at the back makes them difficult to break down and gives them a real chance of winning silverware this season.</p>
<p>Chances of Winning Serie A<br>Napoli are currently second favourites to win the Serie A behind Juventus. They are priced at odds of 11&#x2F;4 with most bookmakers which means that if you fancy them to win, you can get some good value for your money. However, it should be noted that they are still outsiders compared to Juve who are priced at around 2&#x2F;7 with most bookmakers. Nevertheless, Napoli do have a real chance of winning the title this season and they will be confident heading into the final stretch of fixtures. </p>
<p>If you fancy having a bet on Napoli to win Serie A this season, then there are a few markets that you can consider. The first market would be outright winner odds which we have already mentioned above. Secondly, you could consider betting on them to win their next game . Their odds for doing so can vary depending on who they are playing but usually hover around evens or slightly shorter depending on the opponent . Finally , you could also try betting on Napoli qualifiers for Champions League . Again , depending on who they are playing , these odds can vary but tend to be around 2 &#x2F; 1 or thereabouts .</p>
<p>By following our tips , you could make some healthy profits from betting on SSC Napoli this season !</p>
